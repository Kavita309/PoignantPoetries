# PoignantPoetries

A simple application for posting your poetries and viewing others. Poetries can be posted only by the admins of the application, but can be viewed by anybody. Anyone can comment and that comment can be either approved or deleted by the author of that post. Also, after writing a poetry, it goes to the drafts section. It has to be published by its author for the visitors to see it or it can also be deleted.

## Features
- Viewing the poetries posted by all the admins
- Writing a poetry (by an admin)
- Publishing or deleting that poetry (by the admin)
- Commenting on any poetry (by anyone)
- Approving or deleting a comment (by the admin)

#### The Django framework of Python has been used to create the backend and HTML,CSS for the frontend.
